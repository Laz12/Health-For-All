# Health For All
 
Health for All is a Full Stack Project developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. The front-end of the application, which offers users a friendly interface to communicate with the database, was built using HTML and CSS. 
The back-end of the program, which dealt with all database interactions and implemented user permissions based on credentials, was handled by PHP. The database management system that was ultimately chosen to store all of the application's data was MySQL. 
This Full Stack Project allows users to view, edit, delete, and add entries to the database based on their permissions, providing a secure and efficient platform for managing data.
